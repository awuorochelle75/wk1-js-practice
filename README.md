# WEEK1 JS PRACTICE!

#Week 1 Toy problems Prerequisites


#Introduction
This is a challenge lab that requires we the students to undertake some code challenges that reqiures us to solve and write code on the questions asked.
The codes should be written using JavaScript.

The challenges are held in one folder and each challenge is in its own file.

Before starting, you should:
- create a repository on one's individual github account.
-Push the solution to the repository you created.
-Submit the repository link for grading.


#Challenge 1:Student grade generator

This is a challenge that expects us to prompt a user to to input student marks and the corresponding grades to be output.

>Write down the function in your created file and the recommended debugging tool is the browsers console.
>Copy and paste your written code in the console, call out your function and if your code is well written it  brings a prompt for you to enter the marks and you will it output the grades according to your input.

#Challenge 2:Speed Detector
This is a challenge that expects us to come up with a program that takes the speed of a car as  input(speedLimit = 70).If the speed is les than the speedLimit it should print "Ok".Otherwise for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

>Write down the function in your created file and the recommended debugging tool is the browsers console.
>Copy and paste your written code in the console, call out your function and if your code is well written it  brings a prompt for you to enter the speed and  will it output the points according to your input.If the points exceed 12 points it should output "License suspended"
