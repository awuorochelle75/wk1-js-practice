# WEEK1 JS PRACTICE!

#Week 1 Toy problems Prerequisites


#Introduction


This is a challenge lab that requires us to  to solve and write codes based on the questions asked.
The codes should be written using JavaScript.

The challenges are held in one folder and each challenge is in its own file.

Before starting, you should:
- create a repository on one's individual github account.
-Push the solution to the repository you created.
-Submit the repository link for grading.


#Challenge 1:Student grade generator

This is a challenge that expects us to prompt a user to to input student marks and the corresponding grades to be output.

>Write down the function in your created file and the recommended debugging tool is the browsers console.
>Copy and paste your written code in the console, call out your function and if your code is well written it  brings a prompt for you to enter the marks and it will  output the grades according to your input.

#Challenge 2:Speed Detector
This is a challenge that expects us to come up with a program that takes the speed of a car as  input(speedLimit = 70).If the speed is les than the speedLimit it should print "Ok".Otherwise for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

>Write down the function in your created file and the recommended debugging tool is the browsers console.
>Copy and paste your written code in the console, call out your function and if your code is well written it  brings a prompt for you to enter the speed and   it will output the points according to your input.If the points exceed 12 points it should output "License suspended"

#Challenge 3:Net Salary Calculator
This is a challenge that expects us to come up with a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

>You will write down the function  calculateNetSalary that has two arguments basicSalary and benefits which calulates the net salary.
>Write a function inside calculateNetSalary called calculatePaye that will deal with calculateing the gross salary of any individual.
>After this,perform the deductions i.e nssf and shif deductions to arrive at the net Salary.
>Debugg your code using the terminal to identify any mistakes.

When you're done, remember to commit and push your changes up to GitHub.
